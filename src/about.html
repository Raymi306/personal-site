		This website is hosted in Digital Ocean on Ubuntu, using nginx to serve files.
		<br>
		DNS is also managed through Digital Ocean, and purchased through namecheap.
		<br>
		The site does not seek to be backwards compatible with older browsers; Featuring TLS1.3 for security, HTTP2 Push for fast initial page load, and whichever styling and javascript features catch my eye.
		<br>
		<br>
		CSS grid is being used mostly as a learning exercise.
		<br>
		Paletton was used for creating the main page's color scheme.
		The background is actually random text generated in javascript, rendered with a special tiling font from mazeletter.xyz
		Resume content is hidden as of 9/24/2021, it'll be displayed again after more development to the page.
		<br>
		npm, webpack, and rsync are used for asset bundling, optimization, and deployment.
		The tutorial features dead link detection and full unittests on all code samples.
		No more tutorials with code samples that don't do what they say on the box! In theory, anyway...
		It uses python-markdown, jinja2, and bespoke code to accomplish this.
