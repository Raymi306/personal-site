		This website is hosted in Digital Ocean on Ubuntu, using nginx to serve files.
		<br>
		DNS is also managed through Digital Ocean, and purchased through namecheap.
		<br>
		The site does not look to be backwards compatible with older browsers; Featuring TLS1.3 for security, and HTTP2 Push for fast initial page load.
		<br>
		CSS grid is being used mostly as a learning exercise.
		<br>
		Paletton was used for creating the main page's color scheme. The background is actually random text generated in javascript, rendered with a special tiling font from mazeletter.xyz
		<br>
		Feel free to look at this site's <a target="_blank"href="https://github.com/Raymi306/personal-site">github page</a> for more information.
