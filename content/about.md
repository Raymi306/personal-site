# About
This website is hosted in Digital Ocean on Ubuntu with nginx.

DNS is also managed through Digital Ocean, and purchased through namecheap.

Featuring HTTP2 Push for fast initial page load and whichever styling and JavaScript features catch my eye.

CSS grid is being used mostly as a learning exercise.

Paletton was used for creating the main page's color scheme.
The background is actually random text generated in JavaScript, rendered with a special tiling font from [mazeletter.xyz](http://mazeletter.xyz).
I am using [gruvbox-dark](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) for code highlighting.

[zola](https://www.getzola.org/) and rsync are used for content management / site generation and deployment respectively.

The tutorial features dead link detection and full unittests on all code samples.
No more tutorials with code samples that don't do what they say on the box! In theory, anyway...
It uses python-markdown, jinja2, and bespoke code to accomplish this.
The [python tutorial github](https://github.com/Raymi306/python-tutorial) can be found here.

Feel free to look at this site's [github page](https://github.com/Raymi306/personal-site) for more information.
